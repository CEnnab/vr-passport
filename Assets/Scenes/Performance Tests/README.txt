These scenes test performance issues. You'll often want to attach the "FPSInfo.cs" script to a player GameObject. The idea is that we can communicate performance issues to each other by talking about these specific scenes. Some guidelines:

1) Include as few scripts as possible in each scene.
2) Very simple scenes. Example: instead of having 100 instances of 10 animal meshes, use 1000 instances of one mesh.

That's all folks! Happy coding.

The "Demos" folder is a special folder with our best scenes. These are our most feature-complete, bug-free, beautiful scenes. The idea is that non-technical people can fire up this Unity project, open one of these scenes, and be blown away enough to join the project!

Some guidelines:

1) Name the scenes something nice like "crystal peninsula" or "turtle cove". Let's avoid scene names like "VR-test3b-split-heqw" in the "Demos" folder.
2) At most, we should strive to only have a couple scenes in this folder.

The "Tech Demo" scenes in this folder are simple, isolated demonstrations of working scripts. Upon pressing play in Unity, the scene should clearly demonstrate what the script does. The idea is that once we have enough working Tech Demo scenes, designers can combine them into compelling underwater experiences. Some guidelines:

1) Include as few scripts as possible in each scene.
2) Very simple scenes.
3) Name the scene after its script. If two scenes demonstrate the "VisionTracker.cs" script, name the scenes "vision tracker1" and "vision tracker2" etc.
4) Tech Demo scripts should have comments about their use.
5) Tech Demo scripts and scenes should be considered final. Once working they shouldn't change or become broken.

That's all folks! Happy coding.

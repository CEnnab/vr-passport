// Attaching FishLure to a GameObject makes fish attracted to it or repelled by it.
// Attach negative weighted lures to a shark to repel fish, or positive weighted lures to points in space, or breadcrumbs, to attract fish.
// It's also possible to make the FishLure change its strength/weights in cycle, and to make only certain schools respond to certain lures.

// A FishSchool will only use a lure if FishSchool.lureCode == FishLure.lureCode

// lureSettings is how you set the lure to change over time. For example:
// lureSettings[0].weight=1   lureSettings[0].duration=10
// lureSettings[1].weight=0   lureSettings[1].duration=5
// lureSettings[2].weight=0.1   lureSettings[2].duration=50
// In this case, the lure starts with weight 1 for 10 seconds. Then it has weight 0 for 5 seconds, and finally weight 0.1 for 50 seconds. Then it loops back to the start.

// Having a single LureSetting means it will always be on that setting.

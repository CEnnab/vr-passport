If you ever need to import a huge library for VR Cardboard or whatever else, put it here. Some guidelines:

1) Be sure to trim it down as much as possible. If you can delete scripts, or especially large files, please do so. Only keep the minimum of what you really need.
2) Don't include any libraries without a clear license. This project needs to remain free and open source software! Sometimes scripts need to be paid for, and you may have just found a free copy.
